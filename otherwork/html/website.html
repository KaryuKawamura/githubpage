        <h1>Aspiring Webdesigner / Programmer</h1>
        <p>
          Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Karyu Kawamura, and my
          passion for computer science and programming has brought me here. I
          wish to learn everything I can here and hopefully make it my career.
          Below are some of my hobbies and interest! If you like you can also
          check out my photo album of random pictures of myself and my cat.

          <h3>Kittens</h3>
          <p>
            One part of my life right now I can't live without is my pet cat
            "Nia". She is a little bit sassy and lazy, but I still love her the
            same since I adopted her 4 years ago. She lives with my wife and I
            and hopefully we can get another family member for her soon! (cat,
            not children).

          <h3>Gamer</h3>
          <p>
            As my brother has always told me "Gaming is a man's romance". This
            struck close to home, since i've always loved playing video games
            and still watch some of my favorite streamers. This part of my life
            will never leave me as a hobby.

          <h3>Food</h3>
          <p>
            Food has always been my passion. For a good decade of my life i've
            dedicated it to cooking. I was a professional chef by trade and own
            a restaurant in Hong Kong.
